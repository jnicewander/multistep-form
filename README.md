# Multistep Form

This project was made with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), but is pure [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). It currently uses text inputs, and a pair of radio buttons. The radio buttons are used to skip a section depending on which one is selected. 

## Why?

I use this personally as a reference for building multistep forms in React.
